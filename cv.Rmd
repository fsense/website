Meijer. I defended my thesis [Making the Most of Human Memory](https://osf.io/duzya/) on April 20th, 2017.

**Nov 2016 – now**: Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen (department of Psychometrics and Statistics and Department of Experimental Psychology). 

**Sep 2019 – now**: Freelance data scientist at [Infinite Tactics, LLC](https://infinitetactics.com/www/).

<p>After defending my PhD thesis in April 2017, I took the rest of the year off to hike from Canada to Mexico on the Pacific Crest Trail and do other fun things before returning to the University of Groningen as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>

<p><a href="https://flowalks.wordpress.com/">I wrote a blog during the hike that you can find at a separate web address</a>. You can find more information about the PCT more generally on <a href="https://www.pcta.org/">the website of the Pacific Crest Trail Association</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a lot of time and really like walking and eating ungodly amounts of food, I can highly recommend it. </p>
