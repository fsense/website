title: "Sense Data Science"
---

My academic background is in cognitive psychology, computational neuroscience, and cognitive science more generally. Much of my academic work has focused on computational approaches to human learning and forgetting, adaptive e-learning systems, and mathematical modeling of behavioral data and is detailed on this website.

*Sense Data Science* is the company through which I offer a range of data science services as a freelance cognitive data scientist.
